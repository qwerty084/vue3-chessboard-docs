# Callbacks

## Registering

You can register custom callback functions on the board through the config object.
Like other config property, this is optional.

::: warning
The move callback is being executed before the internal board state is updated. Accessing the boardApi can lead to unexpected results.
Use the `move` event provided by the board component to access the API.

```vue [JavaScript]
<script setup>
import { TheChessboard } from 'vue3-chessboard';
import 'vue3-chessboard/style.css';

const boardConfig = {
  events: {
    change: () => {
      // called after the situation changes on the board
      console.log('Something changed!');
    },
    move: (from, to, capture) => {
      // the move function fires after each move on the board, you can access the values from, to, and capture
      // use @move event to access values from the board api. The move function is executed before the state is updated in the board.
      console.log(from, to, capture);
    },
    select(key) {
      // called when a square is selected
      // the param key is the square being selected: e.g. d2 or e2...
      console.log(key);

## Example

<p>Change Counter: {{ changeCounter }}</p>
<p>Latest Move: {{lastMove }}</p>
<p v-if="square">Square {{ square }} has been selected</p>
<p v-else>No square has been selected yet</p>

<div class="chessboard">
  <TheChessboard
    :board-config="boardConfig"
  />
</div>

There are two more methods, which aren't listed above:

- insert
- dropNewPiece

The insert method is fired when a new chessboard is mounted.
You probably will not need this.

dropNewPiece is fired when a new piece is inserted. This feature isnt used currently.
